This is how I took a "non-github" directory, and put all the files from it into a new push into the github:

git clone https://github.com/owhite/eye-control
cd eye-control/
git rm -r *
cp -r /Users/owhite/teensy/eye_control/* .
git status -s
git add *
git status -s
git commit -m 'simplified code, recording with gamepad, and motion detector'
git push origin master
